            <p>
                We have chosen to create an innovative product for students and teachers in Ethiopia. We are based on schools in the country that have access to the internet and a computer. The teacher is assigned a user on the website and logs in at the start of each class. Students in all classes are already added to a system. The teacher easily addresses the absence in the lessons by checking which students are in the lesson, and by doing this it will be easier to get an overview of who is and is not present. There will be a table with the students' names, which day the absence started, how long the student has been away and the reason for the absence. Categories will already be set up for how long the student has been away and which reason(s) the student has been away. We do this to make it easy for the teacher to fill in the table, but also so that it will be easy to categorize and get an overview of the absence in the database. The teacher saves the table with a button below and the information is stored in the database on a national basis.
                This solution solves the problem by giving the country an overview of all absences from school, how long they have been away and why they are gone. In this way, the country can more easily catch up with students who dropout of school, with knowledge of why. It will be easier to create an overview and see trends.

                We want to use the Internet because it is a means 
                that can be easily accessed by teachers with access 
                to it, and it is easy to store and retrieve the data. 
                We have decided to use the internet as our infrastructure,
                mainly beacuse with a little bit of help and funding, it is 
                easily accessible by everyone. Data on the student's health, 
                both physically and mentally, will be collected. This is because 
                there are both physical and mental reasons for not being able to go 
                to school. Other personal information will be information about family 
                and friends, as well as gender, age and class. There are also problems 
                that can prevent the student from attending school or to categorize more 
                easily in the database.

                The data is used to categorize and retrieve students 
                who dropout of school. It is used at a national level by 
                creating an overview and at the local level by those responsible 
                for absence or another solution to bring the students back. It is 
                displayed by a table view in the database and in the tables that the teachers have access to
                Students and teachers must be involved in order to retrieve and provide the data. State officials must be involved in processing the data. Parents and friends are also involved in that they often become the source of why the student is away. Doctors and others in the healthcare system will have to document illness on the students when they are.

            <p>
                We meet the most vulnerable by being able to get an overview of those who are struggling a lot mentally or physically and be able to take measures to get them back to school. The most vulnerable are those who have more long-term problems than a case of flu or cold. Students with depression or who have major problems at home are those who will be easier to detect in the system and thus easier to deal with.
